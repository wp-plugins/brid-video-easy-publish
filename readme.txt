Users will be able to easily search for videos in their Brid Video library. In addition all of your playlists and videos will be easily accessible with editable thumbnail, title and other information about the video. Using a simple user interface, click on the video you want and insert it into your post or page.

Default players for videos and playlists can be set throughout the site to create a consistent look as well as default heights and widths which depend on the player setup. All of these defaults can be overridden at the time of video insertion to allow for customization of a video or player.

In addition this plugin features a live preview of the video or playlist and player so you will know that you have the right video before you add it to your site.
